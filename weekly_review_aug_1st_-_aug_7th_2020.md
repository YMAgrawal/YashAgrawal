## This week has been one of the most interesting week for me in terms of technology, and one of the worst, if not the worst days for academics.
## This weekly review is a place where I want to purely, lay down my plans for business, life and what has already happened in the past
## Business
### For CrashBoards, I have some great plans. There are multiple ventures that I want to lead into my brain child.
### _makeSHIFT_â„¢
#### There are some lavish plans inspired by the [[APACMed Forum 2020]] and its website.
#### The idea is that we bring upon some great people to an intense one day virtual forum, discussing education, liberty in choice, the prevelence of grades and education in the first place by some smart people, eg: [[Ali Abdaal]] and [[Prof. Shafi Ahmed]].
#### I want it to be of virtual grandure, where we ask these amazing people to volunteer and come to talk to us and discuss stuff.
### CrashTalks
#### [[Prof. Shafi Ahmed]] [[Ali Abdaal]] [[Aprajita Ma'am]] are all there for our list of people to interview.
### A note on pricing
#### I am stroke by the realisation, that would I give 30days of my life to teach students for what, 500 - 600 bucks? Maybe not, but, if you look into it, no one is making 15 - 20 bucks a day, are they? That would total to a whoping 105 - 140 bucks a week! Fuck! Thats some money!
